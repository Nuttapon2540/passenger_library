<h1 class="solo-h1">Supported operating systems and languages</h1>

This page documents the operating systems, architectures, programming languages and frameworks that Passenger supports as of version 6.0.19.

## Supported operating systems

Passenger works on almost any POSIX-compliant operating system. In other words: practically any operating system on earth, except Microsoft Windows.

The following operating systems are supported.

<table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
  <tr>
    <th>OS</th>
    <th>Minimum version</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Ubuntu</td>
    <td>20.04</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Debian</td>
    <td>10</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Enterprise Linux</td>
    <td>7</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>macOS</td>
    <td>12 Monterey</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Other Unix</td>
    <td>
      Amazon Linux<br/>
      FreeBSD<br/>
      OpenBSD<br/>
      Solaris<br/>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Best effort

"Other Unix" is supported on a "best-effort" basis. We do not regularly check whether Passenger still works on other Unices, but if users report issues then we'll try to address them.

## Supported architectures

The following architectures are supported.

<table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
  <tr>
    <th>Architecture</th>
    <th>Notes</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>x86_64 (64-bit Intel/AMD)</td>
    <td>-</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>AArch64 (64-bit ARM)</td>
    <td>Arm packages are not available for EL7 RPM based distros at the moment.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Other</td>
    <td>Supported on a <a href="#best-effort">"best-effort"</a> basis.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
